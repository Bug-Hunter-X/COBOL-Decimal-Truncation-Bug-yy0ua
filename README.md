This example demonstrates a common but easily overlooked issue in COBOL programs: truncation of decimal values without explicit error handling. The program attempts to assign a value with two decimal places to a variable that only allows for two decimal places. However, if the value has more than two decimal places, the extra digits are silently truncated. This can lead to unexpected results and makes debugging very difficult. The solution involves using a larger data type or explicitly handling potential truncation scenarios.
